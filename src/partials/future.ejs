  <h4>Future</h4>
  <p>
    I don't necessarily have any specific or detailed plans but I want to produce value and
    meaningful content for others, challenging the status quo and inherent assumptions and pushing
    that line further. Open-source is how I currently break out of my happy medium and advance
    norms.

    For now, I plan on pursuing computer science in the future. Hopefully this summer, I'm able to
    have the opportunity to enroll in a computer science related mentorship or research program.
