    I'm a part of the MST Magnet program at my high school, focusing on computer science research
    projects. I co-founded
    <a target="_blank" href="https://camascoding.netlify.app">Camas Coding Club</a>, where I help
    with web development mentorship and club organization (Hack Club). I'm also a mentor at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://innova.js.org">Innova</a>, a First Lego League team where I
    teach middle-school kids about STEM and entrepreneurship.
