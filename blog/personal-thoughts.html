          There's a common saying that if you are presented with an opprotunity, it is wise to seize
          it. Often, this message is proliferated by people that have achieved success and sell us
          their philiosophies in which we eat up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have subscribed to this philiosophy for 15 years of my life now. More often than not,
          taking opprotunities helped me. In fact, I wouldn't be in the MST Magnet program or honors
          classes if I had not.

          It all hit a stop when I hit sophomore year. Maybe its COVID-19 isolation, or just classic
          sophomore depression, but I've never felt more fatigued and lonely. I imagine that it
          renders down to a few things:
          <ul>
            <li><u>S.O.</u>: I feel emotionally tied but I'm not able to fulfill by own emotional void.</li>
            <li><u>Online School</u>: I'm pressured to work harder by myself and I can't stop the same cycle over and over.</li>
            <li><u>Dark Thoughts</u>: I've always had not ideal thoughts, but it seems to have amplified over the past few months.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to reflect on this in the future.
