          To preface this post, on a social level I am quite naive. I don't understand social cues,
          I make jokes when they aren't appropriate, I'm a pushover and I hate the feeling of not
          being good enough for others ("Social Validation").

          School has recently started for me and I've felt kinda down. It's been quite a struggle
          and the workload is pretty hard to balance but I make it through which is nice. The only
          reason I've stayed sane is through talking with my friends on Discord, usually listening
          to music or chatting in general and its become a really important part of my life.

          I perform decently in school because I basically just no-life homework. In fact, at one
          point I was like 2 weeks ahead on school and I was still working. I guess you can say I'm
          a sweat/tryhard/nerd, but I do it just because I don't feel sound if I'm doing nothing.
          I've traded the fun of life I enjoyed previously for percieved "productivity"
        </p>

          Due to this, I needed something to balance out my life. That's why I turned to my friends,
          who were extremely supportive and I really had a great time. However, as the school year
          progressed on, in parallel with my no-life attitude to school, I feel I was being used by
          a partition of some who I felt closest to.

          I'm not really sure how to write this - It really sucks when you feel like you're getting
          used and the only reason they talk to you is to ask for homework help or vent to you. They
          literally just dump everything on you and don't even bat an eye about anything you do. You
          basically just become an emotional/homework slave and it hurts too much to reject it.
