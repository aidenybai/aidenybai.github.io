          <b>Introducing Lucia</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in August 2020, an idea popped into my head. Over the summer I had tried out and
          built applications with <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and I fell in
          love with the idea of directive-based web development and declarative API. To use Vue, all
          you had to do was pop in a CDN import script, and you were up and running. I wanted to
          replicate the same idea, but with one goal in mind: performance.

          When I first created the initial version of Lucia, I wanted something like
          <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue</a>, but without the bloat. However, I
          immediately faced some performance issues when working on the initial version of Lucia.

        <p>
          My approach was that I take the <code>innerHTML</code> of a the document body, parse it as
          plaintext, render and mutate in memory, and dump it all back into the body. This worked
          fine if I only rendered it once, however once I started rapidly rendering the body over
          and over, it was clear that this solution was <i>extremely</i> inefficient.

          Lucia's Virtual DOM is unlike traditional Virtual DOMs implemented by
          <a href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank">React</a> or
          <a href="https://vuejs.org" target="_blank">Vue</a>, instead it relies on a novi
